Hello! Thanks for visiting. My name is Harry Fisher and I am in the final stages of my PhD at Cardiff Metropolitan University. My research has sought novel ways to predict injury occurrence in athletes using a combination of machine learning techniques and traditional statistical modelling. I have a deep interest in all things data science, especially using R and Python to explore, model and visualise data. Below are some of projects I am working on at the moment, and some posts regarding things I have found interesting/worth sharing. Feel free to get in touch!
