title: PhD summary - Interdisciplinary sports injury prediction
---

If you play any kind of sport, chances are you've had some kind of sports injury. If you've had an injury, you'll know they are not much fun. So why do we get injury in the first place?

Sometimes it's easy to pin point - if a 200 kg running back crashes into you at your local "friendly" tag rugby game, but you're only a 70 kg lightweight, things probably aren't going to end well for you.

Sometimes however, injuries can be more subtle, and they occur due to the result of a combination of different factors that broke some level of tolerance your body could handle.

My PhD aimed to investigate these different factors. Specifically how different sources of stress may interact and increase the risk of injury. While a academic paper is in the works below is a brief summary of my main Study, with a focus in the analysis. I used Bayesian Networks to help explore the probabilistic relationships between different stress-related factors and their effect on injury occurrence..
