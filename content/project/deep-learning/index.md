title: "Deep Learning with R and Python"
---

I recently finished my first [^1] read through of François Chollet's Deep learning with Python and found it extremely informative and surprisingly accessible. The phrase "Deep learning" gets tossed around a fair bit and can seem like something mysterious until you start digging into it. François did a great job at conceptualising what it actually _is_, and how it can be implemented to address a range of different problems.

François is the author of the Keras package which provides a high level interface to one of the main workhorses behind deep learning; googles TensorFlow. I was delighted to see that Keras had been ported over to R, providing R users with an incredibly powerful tool for data analysis. Although my Python skills are slowly improving, they are still a bit behind my understanding of the R language, so I have been working through several of the examples on https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/getting_started.html.

Now my PhD has been submitted I will probably treat myself to François Chollet and J. J. Allaire's [Deep learning in R](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r) and continue diving into this fascinating field.
