As a keen athlete I spent many hours on athletics rankings website 
https://www.thepowerof10.info, comparing my performances to others (never a good idea), and stalking other athletes to see how they got on in competitions. 
For athletics nerds, the site is fantastic and provides all the information you need to keep up to date with the latest results.
However, I wondered if it might be possible to explore some alternative ways of presenting the results...

# Getting the data

Initially, I had to figure out a way to first gather the data from the power of 10 website. 
As you can see in the screenshot below, the rankings are already in a table format, so thankfully it wasn't too difficult to figure something out.

![](/post/2019-08-16-power-of-10-data_files/powerof10homepage.PNG)

This was my first time using the [`rvest`](http://rvest.tidyverse.org/) package, so I'm sure this code can be improved somewhat... It does, however, seem to do the trick!

To start, I got a url from one of the ranking pages.

```{r} 
url <- 'https://www.thepowerof10.info/rankings/rankinglist.aspx?event=100&agegroup=ALL&sex=M&year=2012'
```

Thankfully, to access other pages it was just a case of supplying new values to the arguments in the url. 
For example to get the 200m rankings I could just swap the "event=100" for "event=200" in the string.

To do this, I wrote a simple function that would generate a vector of strings with the desired events, years and for male or female athletes.

```{r url, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(zoo) 
library(knitr)
library(lubridate)

urlmaker <- function(years, events, gender){
  url <- 'https://www.thepowerof10.info/rankings/rankinglist.aspx?event=100&agegroup=ALL&sex=M&year=2012'
  baseevent <- as.character(str_extract_all(url, "[0-9]+")[[1]][[2]])
  baseyear <- as.character(str_extract_all(url, "[0-9]+")[[1]][[3]])
  newyear <- rep(years, times = length(events))
  list_of_years <- str_replace(url, baseyear, newyear)
  newevent <- rep(events, each = length(years))
  yearandevent <- str_replace(list_of_years, baseevent, newevent)
  
  sex <- str_c("sex=", gender, sep = "")
  yearandevent <- str_replace(yearandevent, "sex=M", sex)
  return(yearandevent)
}

```

I then created a string of events and years I wanted to scrape. 
In this instance I only wanted male athletes, so also set gender to "M".
The result was a vector of urls as character strings that I could use to access the necessary pages.

```{r}
events <- c("100", "200", "400", "800", "1500", "3000", "5000", "10000")
years <- as.character(seq(from = 2006, to = 2018, by = 1))
gender <- "M"

# create list of urls to use for scraping
urls <- urlmaker(years, events, gender)

print(head(urls, 3))

```

Next, I had to figure out a way to actually get the data. 
This step involved a fair bit of googling initially, but after a while I realised it was mainly a case of identifying the html labels on the web page. 
The screenshot below shows how I identified the table id on the rankings page (click to zoom in).

[![](/post/2019-08-16-power-of-10-data_files/po10_window.png)](/post/2019-08-16-power-of-10-data_files/po10_window.png)

Once I knew how the different elements on the page were identified, it was as easy as copying and pasting the table id into `html_nodes()` and converting to a table with `html_table()`.
After that it was just the usual wrangling you'd expect with a messy data frame.


```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(rvest)
    
readtable <- function(url) {
  main <- read_html(url)
  rankings <- main %>%
    html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id="cphBody_lblCachedRankingList"]/table') %>%
    html_table() %>%
    data.frame() %>%
    select(1:13) %>%
    set_names(c("Rank", "Perf", "windy", "windspeed", "PB", "newpb", "Name", "agegroup", "month_year", "Coach", "Club", "Venue", "Date")) %>%
    mutate(
      year = as.numeric(str_extract_all(url, "[0-9]+")[[1]][[3]]),
      event = as.numeric(str_extract_all(url, "[0-9]+")[[1]][[2]])
    ) %>%
    mutate_at(vars(Name), list(~replace(., . == "", NA))) %>%
    mutate(Name = na.locf(Name))
}
```


Now I simply had to pass the url to the function, and we'll have the table from the webpage stored as a dataframe.

```{r}
ranks <- readtable(url)

ranks %>% 
  slice(4:6) %>% 
  kable()
```

If I wanted to scrape multiple urls at once I would use `map_df`. Here I can pass my vector of urls and map_df will perform the scarping function `readtable` on each element in the vector and append the result together (this can take a while to complete so I"ll just use the first 3 urls from our vector of 104 urls).

```{r echo=TRUE}
urls_short <- urls[1:3]

male_rankings <- urls_short %>% 
  map_df(readtable)

```

Now we can view the top ranked athlete for each year.

```{r}
male_rankings %>% 
  filter(Rank == "1") %>% 
  kable()
```


## Individual athletes

The PO10 also provides detailed performance history for individual athletes. 
I wanted to be able to have access to this data as well, however I wanted to avoid downloading every individual athletes data to disk as I imagine that may have taken a while...

Instead the solution I came up with was a function get each individual athlete's unique identifier number. 
With this number I could get each athletes individual rankings when required using an "on the fly" scrape, as a single athletes page is not very much data at all.

The screenshot below shows how the code that I needed to extract

[![](/post/2019-08-16-power-of-10-data_files/po10id.png)](/post/2019-08-16-power-of-10-data_files/po10id.png)

```{r echo=TRUE}
athleteurl <- function(url) {
  main <- read_html(url)
  athleteinfo <- tibble(
    Name = html_text(html_nodes(main, "td:nth-child(7) a"), "href"),
    athleteurl = html_attr(html_nodes(main, "td:nth-child(7) a"), "href"),
    year = as.numeric(str_extract_all(url, "[0-9]+")[[1]][[3]]),
    event = as.numeric(str_extract_all(url, "[0-9]+")[[1]][[2]])
  )
  athleteinfo <- athleteinfo %>%
    filter(Name != "")
}
```


```{r}
ids <- athleteurl(url)

head(ids)

```


In another function I join these two tables together so I had one data frame that had all the results and rankings as well as each athletes individual id that I could use to get their individual data.
I also appended the full address to each individual athletes id. 


```{r message=FALSE}
finaljoin <- function(ranks, ids, gender) {
  yeartimes <- ranks %>%
    group_by(year, event) %>%
    filter(str_detect(Rank, "[:alpha:]")) %>%
    select(year, Rank) %>%
    filter(str_detect(Rank, "^UK")) %>%
    separate(Rank, c("topn", "timing"), ": ") %>%
    spread(key = topn, value = timing) %>%
    ungroup()
  cleanrankings <- ranks %>%
    filter(!str_detect(Rank, "[:alpha:]")) %>%
    inner_join(., ids, by = c("Name", "year", "event")) %>%
    mutate(athleteurl = paste("https://www.thepowerof10.info", athleteurl, sep = ""))

  cleanrankings <- left_join(cleanrankings, yeartimes, by = c("event", "year")) %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
    mutate(gender = gender)
}

```

This left me with a complete dataframe I could work with.

```{r}
clean_ranks <- finaljoin(ranks = ranks, ids = ids, gender = "M")

clean_ranks %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kable()
```


The final function I used was to scrape and clean each individuals rankings "on the fly". 
The only input is an athletes individual url, such as: "https://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=31816".

```{r}
individual <- function(athlete) {
  history <- athlete %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id = "cphBody_pnlPerformances"]/table') %>%
    html_table(fill = TRUE) %>%
    .[[2]] %>%
    select(-c(X4, X5, X8, X9)) %>%
    set_names(c("event", "perf", "indoor", "position", "heat", "venue", "meeting", "date")) %>%
    filter(!str_detect(event, "[:alpha:]")) %>%
    mutate(
      date = dmy(date),
      year = substr(date, 1, 4),
      perf_time = case_when(
        str_detect(perf, ":") == FALSE ~ str_c("00:00:", perf),
        str_length(str_split_fixed(perf, ".", 4)[4]) == 3 ~ str_c(perf, "0"),
        str_length(perf) == 6 | str_length(perf) == 7 ~ str_c("00:0", perf),
        str_length(perf) == 8 | str_length(perf) == 9 ~ str_c("00:", perf),
        TRUE ~ perf
      )
    )
  name <- read_html(athlete)
  name <- html_text(html_nodes(name, css = "h2"), trim = TRUE)
  history <- history %>%
    mutate(name = name)
  return(history)
}

```

The result is another dataframe that contains an individual athletes history of performances.

```{r}
athlete <- "https://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=31816"

individual(athlete) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  kable()
```

So that's it! 
I am currently in the process of creating an interactive dashboard to visualise these results. 
You can see the (alpha?!) version here: https://harryfish.shinyapps.io/resultsdashboard/. 
Lots of work left to do, but any comments or feedback are always welcome. 
All the code is on my [github](https://github.com/HarryFisher1/power_of_10) if you want to try anything out.

Thanks for reading!
