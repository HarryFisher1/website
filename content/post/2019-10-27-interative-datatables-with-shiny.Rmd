I was recently given the task of updating our stats team data audting process for GDPR purposes (exciting huh...). Previously this involved running a fairly lengthy r script that found all files listed within a directory and then checking if these files contained potentially senstive data. While this worked, I felt it could be improved and maybe a little more user friendly.

Enter Shiny!
